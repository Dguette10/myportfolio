<h1> The best movies according to Daniela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies off all all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>This movie marked me because it shows BIG social issues we live as human beings in this world.</p>
<h3> 1917</h3>
<p>I love it because of it is style as well as the premise, sometimes it is hard to process but totally worth it.</p>
<h3>White Chicks</h3>
<p>This is the funniest movie ever, in what world you can not recognize 2 FBI agents disguising as 2 delicate and beautiful women!</p>
